== Welcome to MyIT CRM Ruby On  Rails Addition ==
This is a relatively new project which I have been coding for over 16 months
in php and mysql but there was a bunch of code to be written. Then I looked into Ruby and
I was very satisfied after the first use of it. Thinking how this will speed up process cycles.

Anyways more to come but in the meantime check out http://team.myitcrm.com for more details
and the current version of MyIT CRM.
